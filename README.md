# Kubernetes WordPress Deployment Solutions

## Overview

This repository provides solutions for deploying WordPress on Kubernetes while addressing common challenges such as dynamic Pod IP changes, security vulnerabilities, and data integrity concerns. By leveraging Kubernetes features like ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), we ensure a robust and reliable deployment environment for WordPress.

## Features

- **Dynamic IP Management:** Resolve dynamic Pod IP changes by dynamically updating ConfigMaps with MySQL Service IP.
- **Enhanced Security:** Securely store database credentials using Kubernetes Secrets to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure data persistence and integrity with PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for MySQL storage.

## Getting Started

To deploy WordPress with Kubernetes solutions:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/avnish2313/K8s-WordPress-Deployment-Solutions.git`
2. **Navigate to the Repository:** `cd K8s-WordPress-Deployment-Solutions`
3. **Execute Deployment Script:** Run the provided deployment script `deploy.sh` to automate the deployment process.

## Prerequisites
